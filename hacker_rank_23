'''
Beneath the golden sands of Ancient Kemet, Pharaoh Ramses sealed his most prized secrets in a vault of eternal stone. This vault is unlike any other—it does not open with keys or weapons, but with a password carved in strength.

The vault’s mechanism is enchanted with layers of judgment. A weak password causes the walls to close, trapping intruders forever. A medium password grants entry only to false chambers filled with sand. A strong password may open minor treasure rooms, but only the very strong password awakens the true door to the Pharaoh’s hidden legacy.

For centuries, priests studied the hieroglyphs that describe the rules of strength:

Weak – Less than 8 characters, or missing most requirements.
Medium – At least 8 characters, includes two types (uppercase, lowercase).
Strong – At least 8 characters, includes three types (uppercase, lowercase, digit).
Very Strong – At least 12 characters, includes all four types (uppercase, lowercase, digit, special).
