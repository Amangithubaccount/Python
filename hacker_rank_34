'''
A new restaurant, TastyBite, is launching its own online ordering platform. Customers can browse menu items and place orders. Each dish has a name and price. Customers can order multiple items, and the system should calculate their total bill. If a customer orders an item that doesn’t exist, the system should show an error. You need to design a class that supports item addition, ordering, and billing.

Create class Restaurant with:

addItem(name, price)

orderItem(customer, name)

getBill(customer)

Input Format

Q operation details

Constraints

1 ≤ Q ≤ 100

1 ≤ price ≤ 1000

Output Format

Print appropriate messages for each command.

Sample Input 0

6
addItem Pizza 250
addItem Burger 150
orderItem Ram Pizza
orderItem Ram Burger
getBill Ram
getBill Riya
Sample Output 0

Item added
Item added
Ordered Pizza
Ordered Burger
Total bill for Ram: 400
No orders found for Riya
