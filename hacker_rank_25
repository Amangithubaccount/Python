'''
In the Kingdom of Eldoria, the royal treasury stores its jewels in a long chest where each jewel has a unique number engraved on it.

One day, the mischievous prince decided to play a game: he will ask the royal guards to swap jewels at specific positions. The guards must perform the swaps exactly as ordered, otherwise the King will know something is wrong.

You, as the Chief Royal Coder, are tasked to simulate the swapping process. Task

You are given an array of jewels (represented by integers).
You are given a list of swap operations, where each operation consists of two positions (1-based indexing).
After performing all swaps, output the final arrangement of jewels.
example Walkthrough Suppose the chest contains jewels: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50] Swaps: Swap jewel at position 2 with position 5 → [10, 50, 30, 40, 20] Swap jewel at position 1 with position 3 → [30, 50, 10, 40, 20] Final Output: 30 50 10 40 20

Input Format

First line → n space-separated integers (jewel IDs). Second line → integer m (number of swap operations). Next m lines → two integers a b (positions of jewels to be swapped).

Constraints

1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 Jewel IDs are unique integers. 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n

Output Format

Print the final arrangement of jewels after all swaps.
