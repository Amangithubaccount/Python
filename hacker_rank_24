Centuries ago, in the Great Library of Alexandria, thousands of scrolls were meticulously arranged in numerical order by the royal scholars. One day, a fire broke out and the scholars hurriedly evacuated. Now, in 2025, archaeologists have rediscovered part of the library’s underground chamber.

The chamber contains a list of scroll IDs (sorted in ascending order). Each scroll ID is a unique number. However, the chamber is dangerous — explorers have only a few seconds to find the exact scroll before the traps activate.

Your job is to help the archaeologists by writing a Python program using binary search to:

Determine if the target scroll ID exists in the chamber.

If it exists, return the position (1-based index) of the scroll.

If it does not exist, return the nearest smaller scroll ID and the nearest larger scroll ID (if available).

This way, archaeologists know exactly where to dig, even if the exact scroll is missing.

Input Format

First line: n space-separated integers (sorted scroll IDs).

Second lines: n space-separated integers contains a scroll ID to search.

Constraints

1 <= n <= 10^5

Scroll IDs are unique and sorted.

Queries up to 10^4.

Binary search must be used (not linear search).

Output Format

For each query:

If found → Found at position p (1-based index).

If not found → Closest scrolls: smaller = x, larger = y (print "None" if not available).

Sample Input 0

5 12 19 27 34 56 78 90 101 150

Sample Output 0

Sample Input 1

2 4 6 8 10
2 9
Sample Output 1

Found at position 1
Closest scrolls:smaller=8,larger=10
