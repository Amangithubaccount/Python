'''
At BrightFuture University, students take three subjects(Maths,Phusics,English) every semester, and in each subject, they may have single test scores in which max mark is 100. The academic council wants to automate the scholarship eligibility process so professors don’t have to calculate everything manually. Every student’s data is stored in a dictionary, where the key is the student’s name and the value is another dictionary mapping subjects to their test scores. For example, "Alice": {"Math": 90, "Physics": 85, "English":90}. A scholarship is awarded only to the students who demonstrate consistent academic excellence. To be eligible, a student must have an overall average score of at least 85. Additionally, no subject’s average can fall below 70, ensuring that students are not excelling in one area while failing in another. If a student meets both conditions, they are marked "Eligible", otherwise "Not Eligible". Your task is to calculate:

Each student’s overall average score, rounded to two decimals.
Print the student’s name, overall average, and scholarship status in the required format.
