'''
The witches of Umbra Valley forged not one but many cursed necklaces, each strung with glowing beads etched in both upper and lower case letters. These necklaces were designed to trap mortals in layers of repetition and disorder.

The blacksmith-sorcerer’s challenge is no longer simple. To break the curse, he must follow all of these purification rules:

First Occurrence Rule: Keep only the first appearance of each bead (character).
Order Rule: Preserve the original order of the necklace; no rearranging is allowed.
Case-Sensitive Rule: Uppercase and lowercase beads are treated as different entities ('A' ≠ 'a').
Multi-Necklace Rule: If multiple necklaces are given (separated by spaces), each must be purified individually, then joined back with a single space.
Empty Necklace Rule: If, after purification, a necklace becomes empty (all duplicates), print "EMPTY" for that necklace.
Only if all these conditions are met will the blacksmith reveal the true purified collection of necklaces and end the witches’ reign.
