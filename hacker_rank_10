'''
Every night, the town’s Watcher writes down strange noises in his report scroll as a sequence of characters. Most noises are repeated again and again, but sometimes a sound is unique — appearing only once in the whole report. The Watcher must quickly identify the first such unique sound. If no sound is unique, he records -1.

Input Format

A single string (report).

Constraints

Case-sensitive (so 'A' and 'a' are different). 1 ≤ length ≤ 1000.

Output Format

The first non-repeating character, or -1 if none exist.

Sample Input 0

swiss
